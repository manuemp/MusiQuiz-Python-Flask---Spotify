      <h1 class="title yellowpink">Hello! This is MusiQuiz</h1>

      <div class="info-div">
        <p>
            <p class="yellowpink" style="text-align: center;">Click on Login above to start, but first, you may want to read the basic information</p><br>
            
           In this game, you will be connected to the Spotify databases to 
           make quizes about any artist or group you like. (<a href="#important" id="imp-link">important clarification</a>) <br><br>
        
           There are three types of quizes: <br><br>
           - <span class="yellowpink">ArtistQuiz</span>: In this quiz, you will search any artists/groups you like, and test
           how much you know about their songs, albums, etc. <br><br>
    
           The artistQuiz has two basic conditions: <br>
           1. The name of the artist/group has to be inputted with some precission. If the name
           is not properly written, or if the artist is not in Spotify, the Quiz will not be able. <br>
           2. The artist/group must have at least 4 albums. This is because the quiz always makes questions
           about 4 different albums (randomly choosen). If the artist/group does not have enough albums, 
           then the Quiz will be incomplete. <br><br>
    
           - <span class="yellowpink">StreamsQuiz</span>: This quiz makes 5 groups of 4 artists, and you will have to choose for each group
           the artist/group with more total streams in Spotify. Total streams refer to how many times any of the 
           artist/group songs have been played by users. The artists shown in this quiz are on the Spotify's global top 150. <br><br>
    
           - <span class="yellowpink">ListenersQuiz</span>: Same as in StreamsQuiz, but with one important difference, you will have to guess which
           of the artists has more monthly listeners. For your surprise, the results may be considerably different from
           the StreamsQuiz. <br><br><br>
    
           For all quizes your results will be saved, in order to show how accurate you are along the game!
           <br><br>
    
           <h2><span style="color: tomato; text-shadow: 1px 1px red;" id="important">Important!</span></h2>
           In order to connect to the Spotify databases and play, you must log in with your actual Spotify account. <span style="color: yellow;">Absolutely none</span> of your private data will be endangered, because the Spotify API does not provide important user data, 
           only public information is provided, such as the username, ID, playlists, etc (all of which can be accessible from the Spotify app without much effort). <br>
           To log in you will be redirected to Spotify's official Login page, and then redirected to MusiQuiz.
           <br><br>
    
           Hope you enjoy it! Thanks for playing! <br><br>
